Hello! My name is Michael, and I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Scientist.

Currently, I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. My research area focuses on robust Representation Learning in various domains, CV/NLP/RL. In my free time, I follow up on F1 and listen to podcasts.
